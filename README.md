# Risk Prediction Model for Internal Audits

## Objective of the Project

The **primary objective** of this project is to develop a machine-learning model capable of predicting risk in internal audits. By leveraging advanced data analysis and predictive modelling techniques, this project aims to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of risk assessments in audit processes.

## Steps Executed

1. **Data Cleaning:** Initial steps involved handling missing values and removing duplicates to ensure data integrity.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** This provided critical insights into the dataset's characteristics, including the distribution of risk and identification of outliers.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Transformation and encoding of features, such as one-hot encoding for categorical variables and normalization of numerical features.
4. **PCA for Dimensionality Reduction:** Utilizing Principal Component Analysis to reduce feature space while retaining essential information.
5. **Model Development and Evaluation:** Implementing various machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, followed by a thorough evaluation of their performance.

## Why This Project is Useful

This project is particularly useful for organizations seeking to enhance their internal audit processes. The predictive model developed can:

- **Improve Accuracy:** By accurately predicting potential risk areas.
- **Save Time:** By automating parts of the risk assessment process.
- **Inform Decision Making:** By providing data-driven insights into risk factors.

## Key Results and Insights

- **High Accuracy:** The Gradient Boosting model achieved an accuracy of approximately 97.4% and a ROC AUC score of around 96.6%.
- **Effective Feature Reduction:** PCA was successfully employed to reduce the number of features, simplifying the model without significant information loss.
- **Model Generalization:** The chosen model demonstrates an ability to generalize well to new, unseen data.

## Getting Started with the Project
